# Sunrise

The software for a Raspberry Pi controlled alarm clock, with an IN-12 Nixie Tube display, and an alarm which both gradually brightens your Phillips Hue lamps and plays a web radio station of your choosing.

## Build

Full build details will be added to [the build log](docs/build.md) as it progresses.

## Installation

Sadly this project is in its _very_ early stages. There is nothing to run yet!

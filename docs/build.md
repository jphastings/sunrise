## Manufacture

We've used a small piece of stripboard to join various parts of the system together, particularly the power rails:

![Stripboard design](designs/stripboard.png)

The 12V supply arriving over passive PoE is used to power the Nixie power module and, via the DC/DC converter, the Raspberry Pi. The ground rails for each part are kept separate to prevent fluctuations from affecting the operation of the Raspberry Pi.

The HV power lines from the Nixie power module are connected directly to the Nixie Driver (see [page 5 of the spec](hardware/ogilumen/nxie driver board.pdf) for pins).

The GPIO pins have been chosen broadly at random, feel free to move them if you change the appropriate parts of the code.

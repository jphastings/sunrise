# Nixie

The component which controls the Nixie Duo so as to display the time, or the selected alarm time.

## Hardware

This code has been written with the Ogi Lumen Nixie Duo in mind. Sadly their website is no longer functioning, however the [Nixie Driver](../../docs/hardware/ogilumen/nixie driver board.pdf) and [Nixie Duo](../../docs/hardware/ogilumen/nixie duo board.pdf) board assembly details were still floating around on the internet, so I've added them to this repo.

If you have a copy of the Eagle CAD files for these boards I'd be interested in [hearing from you](https://twitter.com/jphastings) as they're no longer available on their website, which has vanished.
